## How to use the App

### Desktop Viewport

Tab through or click on a location displayed on the sidebar menu to show it's associated information upon it's marker on the map. Also, perform a search by typing words on the search bar, to see if a matching a location in the neighbourhood is returned on the sidebar!

### Mobile Viewport

There are two ways to navigate the app:

* Text Input: type words on the search bar, then scroll through the resulting locations displayed. Touch any of them to see associated information. To perform another search, erase the words seen on the search bar's text input with the backspace button of your virtual keybord.
* Inverted Triangle Button: Touch the search bar to display a inverted triangle button. Touch it to scroll through neighbourhood's locations. Touch a location to see it's location be the only one remaining and do a bounce animation, while showing the locations details. The search bar should now be filled by the selected location's name. Erase it by hiting the backspace button on your virtual keyboard to restore the whole location list upon input on the inverted triangle button, or to perform a search based on typing a word on the search bar text area.

## Project's Bootstrapp

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
